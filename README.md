# Reality Lab — Soongsil University

Official website source and management infrastructure for the Reality Lab
at Soongsil University (숭실대학교 리얼리티 연구실).

**Live site**: [reality.ssu.ac.kr](https://reality.ssu.ac.kr)
**Hosted by**: GitHub Pages
**Theme base**: Agency Bootstrap → Jekyll

## What lives in this repo

**New here? Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first** — it is the one-pass handover.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Static site** | `_data/`, `_includes/`, `_layouts/`, `_sass/`, `assets/`, `*.md`, `*.html` | Jekyll source. Built by GitHub Pages, served at reality.ssu.ac.kr |
| **Chatbot backend** (live) | [`worker/`](worker/) | Cloudflare Worker. Fixed URL, free tier, no machine of ours to keep awake |
| **Admin CMS** | [`admin_cms/`](admin_cms/) | Password-protected UI to edit `_data/*.yml` (publications, members, news) with backups, audit log, and git commit |
| **Ops scripts** | [`scripts/`](scripts/), [`scripts/migrate/`](scripts/migrate/) | Join-date stamping, Windows tasks, server bootstrap, tunnel management |
| **Old chatbot backend** | [`ai_server/`](ai_server/) | Flask + local RAG. Retired in 2026-08; kept for reference, **not live** |

The site and the chatbot run without any machine of ours being on. **Only the
admin CMS still needs this PC**, and it is reached through a Cloudflare tunnel
whose URL is auto-committed back into the repo so `/admin.html` can redirect to it.

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ssurealitylab/ssurealitylab.github.io.git
cd ssurealitylab.github.io
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --trace
open http://localhost:4000
```

For chatbot + admin work, follow the setup in [`scripts/migrate/README.md`](scripts/migrate/README.md)
— the same script that bootstraps a fresh production server works locally too.

Python deps live in two files: [`ai_server/requirements.txt`](ai_server/requirements.txt)
(chatbot) and [`admin_cms/requirements.txt`](admin_cms/requirements.txt) (CMS).

### Running on Windows

The chatbot and CMS are platform-neutral — they pick their file-lock, process
detach, and `bundle` lookup per platform — so a plain checkout runs as-is. Two
things bite anyway, neither of them a code problem:

- **Ruby.** Install [RubyInstaller **with MSYS2**](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
  (`x64-mingw-ucrt`), not conda's ruby. Conda ships an `mswin` build, and
  `commonmarker` / `eventmachine` do not compile under MSVC. Keep `BUNDLE_PATH`
  **outside** the repo, or Jekyll scans `vendor/` and dies parsing a gem's own
  `site_template` fixture.
- **Console encoding.** Set `PYTHONUTF8=1`. On a cp949 console the servers'
  emoji progress prints raise, and the exception takes `load_rag()` down with
  it — leaving a chatbot that starts fine and then answers with no RAG context.

## Editing content

Most non-code changes happen in `_data/`:

| File | What it drives |
|---|---|
| `_data/publications.yml` | All publications (see [`_data/README_PUBLICATIONS.md`](_data/README_PUBLICATIONS.md)) |
| `_data/members.yml` | Faculty / students / interns / alumni |
| `_data/news.yml` | News feed on the homepage |
| `_data/research_areas.yml` | Research area cards |
| `_data/version.yml` | Auto-updated footer version (see [`VERSION_UPDATE.md`](VERSION_UPDATE.md)) |

Two ways to edit them:

1. **Admin CMS** — recommended. Open the admin URL, log in, use the form UI. It validates the schema, keeps a timestamped backup, and commits + pushes for you.
2. **Directly in git** — for large or structural changes. Push to `main`; GitHub Pages rebuilds in 1–3 minutes.

> The `international.md` publication list is **hardcoded HTML**, not driven
> from `publications.yml`. When you add a paper, update **both**. See the
> comment block at the top of `international.md` for the pattern.

Directories intentionally **not** committed (see `.gitignore`):
- `_site/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/` — build/runtime output
- `.env`, `admin_cms/admin_config.json` — secrets
- `finetune_env/`, `reality_lab_qwen*/`, `qwen_reality_lab_lora/` — legacy ML experiments (predate the OpenAI-backed chatbot)

## Deployment / hand-off to a new server

The chatbot no longer lives on a server of ours -- it is a Cloudflare Worker,
so there is nothing to move; see [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md).

What follows covers the **admin CMS**, which does still need a machine.
Everything needed to move it to a fresh box is in
[`scripts/migrate/`](scripts/migrate/). The new person only needs:
1. This repo's URL
2. An OpenAI API key
3. A password of their choice for the admin UI

Then:
```bash
git clone <this repo>
./scripts/migrate/bootstrap_new_server.sh
# fill in .env when it asks
./scripts/migrate/bootstrap_new_server.sh   # idempotent — resumes from where it stopped
```

See `scripts/migrate/README.md` for the full playbook, systemd units, cron
template, and rollback procedure.
